I visualized the code on Python Tutor and realized that, upon reassignment, while `alice` `bob` and `charlie` were no longer pointing at the functions, the function objects themselves still existed, and were (only) accessible through the dictionary.\"\n"

    "### Magic Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "There were multiple ways to solve this problem. Alluding to other approaches, gilch gave me an introduction to magic methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Python, certain double-underscore (or \"dunder\") names are special cases with \"magic\" behaviors. You generally aren't supposed to call these directly, but you do implement them pretty often. They serve as user-definable hooks into certain processes. `__init__` and `__new__` are examples of these. Many so-called builtin functions just call the corresponding magic method. `str()` calls `.__str__()`, `repr()` calls `.__repr__()`, `len()` calls `.__len__()`, and so forth. Sometimes the magic methods only implement part of the process, so it's usually better to use the normal process rather than calling the dunder methods yourself. Being familiar with what these are and how they work is important to advanced Python programming. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> >>> class Foo:\n",
    ">     def __len__(self):\n",
    ">         return 42\n",
    "> \n",
    ">     \n",
    "> >>> Foo()\n",
    "> <__main__.Foo object at 0x000001E5097AD910>\n",
    "> >>> len(_)\n",
    "> 42\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Here, the Foo instance is certainly not any kind of collection or iterable, but it implements the required protocol for `len()` to work. Thus, it has a \"length\". \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Here's a more interesting case:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> >>> class Foo:\n",
    ">     def __add__(self, other):\n",
    ">         return 42\n",
    "> \n",
    ">     \n",
    "> >>> Foo() + object()\n",
    "> 42\n",
    "> >>> object() + Foo()\n",
    "> Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    ">   File \"<pyshell#61>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    ">     object() + Foo()\n",
    "> TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'object' and 'Foo'\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> One of the ways to solve the puzzle using a class is with the \"callable\" protocol. You can implement that with `__call__`. The ability to easily implement operators for custom types like this is one of the major reasons Python is big in data science. Numpy arrays, for example, implement a lot of these magic methods. I don't know if you ever got to \"operator overloading\" in C++, but this is Python's equivalent. The `()` as in `foo()` or `Foo.foo()` is the call operator. It is possible for a class to implement this operation for its instances, just like I did with `__add__` and `+`. It's actually one of the most straightforward operators to implement, because it's a lot like writing a normal function. Can you solve this one by using `__call__` instead of `__new__`? "
